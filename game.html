        <h1>What was happening with the code for those questions?</h1>
        <h2>Each question was asked using a JavaScript prompt. Prompt is used for any dialog box that is receiving input.</h2>
        <h3>The answers are made into variables so we can call the results at a later time. In order to avoid issues with the format of the inputs received you have to make all of the answers lower case to ensure that any amount of capitalization will still count as an applicable answer (unless it is spelled incorrectly).</h3>
        <h4>Your inputs are compared to the correct answer in an if-else statement and assigned a variable name to call when displaying the results.</h4>
        <h5>The number of correct answers is calculated, and is displayed as an alert after your response to the prompt asking your name. This alert and the following alerts informing you of the correct answers is a concatenated string.</h5>
        <h6>All of the aforementioned steps must be added within the script tags so that the computer knows how to process them.</h6>
